1. recursion is when a function calls itself inside itself. recursion has a limit. while loops is when the computer does something over and over again as long as a condition
is met. it has no limit and should be used instead of recursion when possible

2. recursion has a limit meaning it can only happen a certain amount of times. it also goes in both directions. while loops are easier for the computer to do and are
typically better to use since they don't go in both directions
